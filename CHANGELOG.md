All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## 2026-06-26

Added prompt-type detection routing to the `prompt-engineer` skill. A deterministic `UserPromptSubmit` pre-scorer (`hooks/prompt-detect.py`) scores each prompt against a shared type taxonomy (`refs/categories.json`) and injects a `<prompt-detect>` block; the new detection protocol (`refs/detect.md`) consumes it, handles the `--global` escape hatch, and resolves a `prompt_type` (code, creative-writing, image-gen, question, text-gen, or none). Principles now layer a global base plus type-specific sections, and the protocol expands from six to seven steps. Detection hook wired in `.claude/settings.json`.

## 2026-06-24

Initialized the `prompt-engineer` skill — a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that automatically classifies, rewrites, and presents enhanced versions of user prompts before execution. Ships with a principles table (additive and subtractive) and a six-step protocol driving the full classify → select → rewrite → approve flow. Kermit changelog tooling also initialized.
